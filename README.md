## Welcome to my site

I'm Billy, a 16 year old iOS developer/beginner hacker interested in mobile security research and exploitation on ARM. On this site you will see various written tutorials related to exploit development and hacking aimed at beginners as well as a bit about me.

I also run a YouTube channel teaching similar things which you can find [here](https://youtube.com/c/BillyEllis).

### Tutorials

The first set of tutorials on this site are based around the basic concepts of binary exploitation specifically on the ARM platform. This will apply to most mobile devices but it's best if you use an iOS device to follow along as that's what I'll be using.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Billy-Ellis/Billy-Ellis.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
